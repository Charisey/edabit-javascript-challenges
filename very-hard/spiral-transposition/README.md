Create a function that takes a two-dimensional array as an argument and returns a one-dimensional array with the values of the original 2d array that are arranged by spiralling through it (starting from the top-left).

### Examples

```
[
[7, 2], ➞ [7, 2, 0, 5]
[5, 0]
]

[
[1, 2, 3],  
[4, 5, 6], ➞ [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
[7, 8, 9]
] 

[
[1, 1, 1],  
[4, 5, 2], ➞ [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
[3, 3, 2] 
]

[
[1, 4, 3, 9],
[2, 5, 7, 1], ➞ [1, 4, 3, 9, 1, 3, 1, 9, 5, 4, 8, 2, 5, 7, 2, 6]
[8, 6, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 9, 1]
]

[
[1, 5],
[9, 2], ➞ [1, 5, 2, 3, 7, 9]
[7, 3]
]

[
[2, 4, 6, 8], ➞ [2, 4, 6, 8, 5, 1, 3, 7]
[7, 3, 1, 5]
]
```

### Notes

If you do not understand the instructions, write the 3x3 array example on a piece of paper and trace the output through it.
