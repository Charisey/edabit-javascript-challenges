Create a function that takes a string and replaces each letter with its appropriate position in the alphabet.

### Rules
- Replace all letters with position in alphabet.- If anything in the string isn't a letter, ignore it.- a is 1, b is 2, c is 3, etc, etc.
### Examples

```
alphabetIndex("We have a lot of rain in June.") ➞ "23 5 8 1 22 5 1 12 15 20 15 6 18 1 9 14 9 14 10 21 14 5"

alphabetIndex("The river stole the gods.") ➞ "20 8 5 18 9 22 5 18 19 20 15 12 5 20 8 5 7 15 4 19"

alphabetIndex("Wow, does that work?") ➞  "23 15 23 4 15 5 19 20 8 1 20 23 15 18 11"
```

### Notes

Ignore non letter characters, otherwise there aren't any intentional gotchas.
